Based on feedback from the ATPESC tutorial:

1. MPI programmers are still not really understanding the perspective shift necessary to understand what SDAG is all about.
a. suggest an example side by side comparison to lead MPI programmers into the object oriented and asynchronous thinking of Charm++.  Possibly AMR, though that may be too complicated.

2. People would like a "what applications are Charm++ especially good for" list.  Yes, it could be used for anything.  However that is just cheerleading.  People want a more objective list of application characteristics that would motivate adoption of Charm++.  As a first pass, if the application has static balance, large granularity, and bulk synchronous use of collectives, there is negligible benefit from Charm++ and may be better served by MPI.
