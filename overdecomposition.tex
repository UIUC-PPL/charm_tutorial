  \begin{itemize} 
    \item Let the programmer decompose computation into objects
    \begin{itemize}
       \item Work units, data-units, composites
    \end{itemize}
    \item Let an intelligent runtime system assign objects to processors
    \begin{itemize}
      \item RTS can change this assignment (mapping) during execution
      \item Locality of data references is a critical attribute for performance 
      \item A parallel object can access only its own data
      \item Asynchronous method invocation for accessing other objectsâ€™ data
      \item RTS can schedule work whose dependencies have been satisfied
    \end{itemize}
