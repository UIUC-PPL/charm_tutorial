\framesubtitle{Benefits of Object-based code}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Objects encapsulate data
        \item Methods represent functionality relevant to that data
        \item Method invocations can modify / update state of the object / data
        \item Computation can be expressed in terms of objects interacting via method invocations
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{block}{}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Methods are natural units of sequential computation on object data
        \item Thoughtful design yields focused methods with single purpose
        \item Naturally expresses an object's response to inputs (signals / data)
    \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Nothing new
        \item Still quite uncommon in HPC code
        \item Its not about language syntax. Its about program structure
    \end{itemize}
