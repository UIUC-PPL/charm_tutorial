      \begin{itemize}
      \item Very similar to sequential code
      \item Tied to notion of communicating ranks
      \item Explicitly states order of computation and communication
      \item However no semantic connection between computation and its communication dependencies
      \item Data is not well encapsulated.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Objects encapsulate data
        \item Methods represent functionality relevant to that data
        \item Method invocations can modify / update state of the object / data
        \item Computation can be expressed in terms of objects interacting via method invocations
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{block}{}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Methods are natural units of sequential computation on object data
        \item Thoughtful design yields focused methods with single purpose
        \item Naturally expresses an object's response to inputs (signals / data)
    \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Nothing new
        \item Still quite uncommon in HPC code
        \item Its not about language syntax. Its about program structure
    \end{itemize}
